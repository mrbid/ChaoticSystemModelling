# ChaoticSystemModelling
This is an experiment to see how well a Feed-forward Neural Network could model a chaotic system.

- [EntireSimulation](EntireSimulation) attempts to simulate every position of a sphere at each timestep of the simulation.
- [CollisionsSimulation](CollisionsSimulation) attempts to simulate just the collisions and the reflected vector for every sphere.
